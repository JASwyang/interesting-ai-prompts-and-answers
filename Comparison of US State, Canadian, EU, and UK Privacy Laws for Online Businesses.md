# Comparison of US State, Canadian, EU, and UK Privacy Laws for Online Businesses

This was generated on April 23 after an involved chat at grok.com (grok3 engine).

This chart compares 20 US state privacy laws, Canada’s PIPEDA, the EU GDPR, and the UK GDPR in plain terms, focusing on what an online business needs to do to comply. These laws apply if you collect personal data (like names, emails, or browsing habits) from people in these regions and meet certain thresholds (e.g., number of customers, revenue, or business activities). They give people rights over their data and set rules for businesses. The chart lists US states alphabetically, followed by non-US jurisdictions alphabetically, with law names/acronyms included.

### Key Points for Online Businesses:
- **Consumer Rights**:
  - US States: Most let people see, delete, or correct their data and opt out of ads or data sales. California, Maryland, and Rhode Island add rules for sensitive data (e.g., health, race).
  - PIPEDA: Canadians can see, correct, or delete data and withdraw consent for its use.
  - EU/UK GDPR: Broadest rights, including data portability (getting data in a usable format) and objecting to automated decisions (e.g., profiling).
- **Privacy Policy**:
  - All laws require a clear privacy policy explaining what data you collect, how you use it, and user rights.
  - EU/UK GDPR demand very detailed policies and clear language.
  - Rhode Island’s RIDTPPA requires any website selling data to list third parties it “has sold or may sell” data to, even if small.[](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/rhode-island-enacts-data-transparency-and-privacy-protection-act-joining-us-data)[](https://www.osano.com/articles/rhode-island-data-transparency-and-privacy-protection-act-ridtppa)
- **Response Time**:
  - US States: Mostly 45 days (Iowa allows 90 days).
  - PIPEDA: 30 days.
  - EU/UK GDPR: 1 month (extendable to 2 for complex cases).
- **Consent and Sensitive Data**:
  - US States: Some (e.g., Virginia, Maryland, Rhode Island) require consent for sensitive data (health, kids’ data).
  - PIPEDA: Requires consent for most data collection/use.
  - EU/UK GDPR: Strict consent rules (or other legal basis) for all data, especially sensitive data (health, religion, etc.).
- **Exemptions**:
  - US States: Small businesses often exempt (except Texas). Nonprofits and HIPAA-covered businesses (e.g., healthcare) usually exempt. Rhode Island exempts nonprofits, HIPAA/GLBA data, and employment data.[](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2826/2024-07-16-rhode-island-enacts-comprehensive-privacy-law)[](https://www.nixonpeabody.com/insights/alerts/2024/07/26/rhode-island-enacts-data-privacy-law)
  - PIPEDA: Applies to all commercial businesses unless overridden by provincial laws (e.g., Quebec’s Law 25).
  - EU/UK GDPR: No size exemptions; applies if you target EU/UK residents.
- **Penalties**:
  - US States: Fines vary; California’s are highest ($7,500 per intentional violation). Rhode Island fines $100-$500 per intentional disclosure, up to $10,000 per violation. Only California allows private lawsuits (e.g., for breaches).[](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/rhode-island-enacts-data-transparency-and-privacy-protection-act-joining-us-data)[](https://natlawreview.com/article/rhode-island-ocean-state-sails-privacy-waves)
  - PIPEDA: Fines up to CAD $100,000 per violation.
  - EU/UK GDPR: Heaviest fines (€20M/£17.5M or 4% of global revenue), enforced by regulators.
- **Unique Features**:
  - **California - CCPA/CPRA**: Requires “Do Not Sell My Info” link, broadest scope.
  - **Colorado - CPA**: Supports browser opt-out signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control).
  - **Maryland - MODPA**: Strong health/kids’ data protections.
  - **Florida - FDBR**: Only for huge businesses ($1B+ revenue).
  - **Rhode Island - RIDTPPA**: Broad privacy notice for all websites selling data, no cure period, no data minimization, no universal opt-out.[](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/rhode-island-enacts-data-transparency-and-privacy-protection-act-joining-us-data)[](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2826/2024-07-16-rhode-island-enacts-comprehensive-privacy-law)[](https://www.osano.com/articles/rhode-island-data-transparency-and-privacy-protection-act-ridtppa)
  - **Canada - PIPEDA**: Focuses on consent and accountability, less prescriptive than GDPR.
  - **EU - GDPR/UK - UK GDPR**: Requires data breach notifications (72 hours), Data Protection Officers for large businesses, and strict cross-border data transfer rules (e.g., EU-US Data Privacy Framework).

### Tips to Comply:
- **Know Your Customers**: Track where users live (US states, Canada, EU, UK) to know which laws apply.
- **Update Your Website**: Add a detailed privacy policy and a form for data requests (e.g., access, deletion) covering all regions. For Rhode Island, list third parties for data sales in your policy.[](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/rhode-island-enacts-data-transparency-and-privacy-protection-act-joining-us-data)
- **Secure Data**: Use encryption and strong security to protect customer info (critical for GDPR/PIPEDA).
- **Get Consent**: Use clear consent forms for EU/UK/Canada users and sensitive data in some US states (including Rhode Island).
- **Handle Data Transfers**: For EU/UK data, use tools like the EU-US Data Privacy Framework or Standard Contractual Clauses.
- **Train Staff**: Ensure your team knows how to handle data requests and breaches.
- **Check Regularly**: Laws evolve (e.g., new US state laws, Canada’s proposed updates), so stay updated. Rhode Island’s ambiguities (e.g., “personally identifiable information”) may need clarification before 2026.[](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2826/2024-07-16-rhode-island-enacts-comprehensive-privacy-law)

This chart simplifies complex laws. Consult a lawyer to ensure full compliance, especially for sensitive data, cross-border transfers, or customers in multiple regions.
